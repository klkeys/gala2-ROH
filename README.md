# gala2-ROH
Computational pipeline for GALA II project analyzing the phenotypic consequences from genomic autozygosity, as measured by runs of homozygosity (ROH).

## Installation

Clone from the Github website, or from the command line:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:asthmacollaboratory/gala2-ROH.git
```

Analyses require recent copies of the following software:
* [PLINK 1.9](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 3.4 or greater)
* [METAL](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/METAL)

Some data analyzed here were generated with the following software:
* [RFMix](https://github.com/slowkoni/rfmix) (version 1 should also work)
* [GARLIC](https://github.com/szpiech/garlic)

See websites for software packages for installation instructions.

## R packages

Association analyses rely on the following R packages:
* `assertthat`
* `coda`
* `data.table`
* `doParallel`
* `dplyr`
* `ggplot2`
* `ggpubr`
* `ggrepel`
* `grid`
* `gridExtra`
* `MASS`
* `optparse`
* `qqman`
* `RColorBrewer`
* `readr`
* `reshape2`
* `stringr`
* `doSNOW`

## Analyses

See the README files for individual association analyses:
* [ROH](./analyses/roh/README.md)
* [GWAS](./analyses/gwas/README.md)

Note that the GWAS relies on a phenotype-covariate file generated by the ROH analysis pipeline.
Therefore, run the ROH pipeline first.
